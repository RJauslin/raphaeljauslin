I"≥<p>Hi :wave:</p>

<p>My name is Rapha√´l Jauslin.  I currently do a PhD thesis at the University of Neuch√¢tel under the supervision of the Professor Yves Till√©.</p>

<h2 id="studies">Studies</h2>

<p>I did my MSc in applied mathematics at the <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/applied-mathematics/">Ecole polytechnique f√©d√©rale de Lausanne</a>.</p>

<p>My research focuses on sampling theory. I mainly worked on sampling theory for spatial populations but also on methods to find a balanced sample in highly stratified populations.</p>

<p>The methods we have developed are available in two R packages. The packages are <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/WaveSampling/">WaveSampling</a> and <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/StratifiedSampling/">StratifiedSampling</a>. You can see recent posts for examples of how to use the functions in the packages.</p>

<p>You can also download the latest versions of the packages from my github page.</p>

<p>In my free time, I like to run in the mountain :mount_fuji: or windfoil on Neuch√¢tel‚Äôs lake :surfer:.</p>
