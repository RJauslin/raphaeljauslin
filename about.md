Hi :wave:

My name is Raphaël Jauslin.  I currently do a PhD thesis at the University of Neuchâtel under the supervision of the Professor Yves Tillé.

## Studies

I did my MSc in applied mathematics at the [Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne]( https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/applied-mathematics/). 

## Research

My research focuses on sampling theory. I mainly worked on sampling theory for spatial populations but also on methods to find a balanced sample in highly stratified populations.

The methods we have developed are available in two R packages. The packages are [WaveSampling](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/WaveSampling/) and [StratifiedSampling](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/StratifiedSampling/). You can see recent posts for examples of how to use the functions in the packages.

You can also download the latest versions of the packages from my github page.

## Hobbies

In my free time, I like to run in the mountain :mount_fuji: or windfoil on Neuchâtel's lake :surfer:.
